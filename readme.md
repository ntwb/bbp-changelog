## bbPress Changelog Generator

Takes all relevant commits from bbPress Trac and renders it to a format suitable for a changelog post on the bbPress codex.

### How to use

  - Edit `index.php` and modify the values in the "Settings" section
  - Run `index.php` in a browser.  This will render all the commits from Trac into a format ready for pasting into WP's editor.
  - View the page source to copy the HTML.  Then, paste into a new file for further editing.  The rest of the points require some manual work:
      - Move the commits into the relevant sections as specified on the rendered page.
      - Modify the commit messages to suit user consumption:
         - Remove references to "Props ...", "See ...", "Fixes ..."
         - Merge multiple commits referencing the same ticket
         - Remove commits referencing the older maintenance branch
         - Rephrase or summarize where needed, etc.
  - Once ready, copy and paste the contents into the bbPress codex changelog post (eg. codex.bbpress.org/releases/version-2-X)
